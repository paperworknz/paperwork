					<h1 class="main_title">About us</h1>
					<p>
						<span class="minor_title">Paperwork is the result of helping a friend upgrade from spreadsheets and look for a modern, simple system to handle and 
							increasing amount of quotes and invoices.
						</span>
						Everything we found was either:
					</p>
					<ul class="list">
						<li>Too slow/clunky</li>
						<li>Too complex and expensive</li>
						<li>Too hard to understand</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						So Paperwork was born. Paperworks goals were simple and clear:
					</p>
					<ul class="list" style="font-weight: 600;">
						<li>Fast, beautiful and hassle-free</li>
						<li>Dead simple, but with a solid structure to scale as your business grows</li>
						<li>Keep it's purpose small so it can adapt and evolve quickly</li>
						<li>Plug 'n play, pick it up and start using it instantly</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						We enjoy keeping things small and simple. We only build what is necessary, and continue to shape and improve that over time. Paperwork is not for all types of business, 
						Paperwork is purposefully designed to be small and lightweight. You won't find cluttered interfaces with every feature possible. (Although there won't be much 
						stopping you from <a href="{{environment.root}}/pricing">scaling up as you need to</a>) And we don't account for all possible workflows. 
						We like it that way. It's what keeps Paperwork hassle free and easy to pick up and go.
					</p>
					<p>
						Paperwork is for the following type of people:
					</p>
					<ul class="list">
						<li>You like lightweight tools that <strong>do one thing and one thing well</strong></li>
						<li>You are looking to <strong>reduce as much hassle</strong> as possible</li>
						<li>You recognise <strong>structure is key to a streamlined system</strong>, but you don't need to take it to the extreme</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						Paperwork is proudly developed and maintained from New Zealand, is available worldwide, and uses world-class technology to provide a beautiful experience. 
						We fanatically build and improve Paperwork every day. We'd like to get to know you, say hi!
